# Project-Euler-Practice
My attempts at Project Euler problems, and insight on how to optimize the solutions
This is pretty much a living document to show my progress in programming and trying to solve those pesky PE problems.  
While I can get some correct, the code is far from optimized.  I'd love insight on how to more efficiently code and solve these problems. :)
